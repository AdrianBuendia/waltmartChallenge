Android Developer Assessment
This is a technical assessment for an Android developer using Java/Kotlin as the programming
language. The test will cover topics related to Android app development, Kotlin/Java language,
and commonly used Android libraries.
Please note that the actual implementation code for each exercise would require building
Android app components, and the provided responses are simplified examples for the given
tasks.


Exercise 1: RecyclerView and Data Binding

the product data from an API endpoint and display the product name and price in each
